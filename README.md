Read about it on [my website](https://www.nqind.com/index.php/project-showcases/20-obamium-the-remote-start-from-scratch-2019).

We want to use:
- TOTP (thru DTMF over FM)
- ESP32-C3
- Rust :3

To do:
- [ ] DTMF decode
- [ ] interrupt & deep sleep
- [ ] NTP sync
- [ ] generate TOTP codes
- [ ] GPIO assignment
- [ ] integration nightmare
